Allows you to use media from other blogs in a Multisite environment.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new tab to the "Add Media" window, allowing you to access media in other blogs.

It can be very helpful when you use [Multisite Language Switcher](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-language-switcher/) plugin for setting up a multilingual site as it prevents the editors from having to upload images twice.

Based on a blogpost by [Aaron Eaton](http://blog.channeleaton.com/sharing-media-libraries-across-network-sites).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= About Permissions =

This plugin depends on the global WordPress blog permissions for viewing and editing Media.

Only blogs where the user has 'upload_files' permission are shown in the Network Shared Media tab.

If a user doesn't have the 'upload_files' permission on the current (active) blog, the tab isn't shown at all since that user can't access the Add Media pop-up window.

= I still can't see the site listed! =

A site can have several attributes which can be set through /wp-admin/network/sites.php .

This plugin only shows sites which attributes are set as follows:

* Public: true
* Archived: false
* Spam: false
* Delete: false
* Mature: ignored

== Screenshots ==
1. New tab added to the Add Media popup window
2. The Network Shared Media tab lists the media per site
3. Show a selected image and "Insert into Post"
