Allows you to use media from other blogs in a Multisite environment.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new tab to the "Add Media" window, allowing you to access media in other blogs.

It can be very helpfull when you use [Multisite Language Switcher](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-language-switcher/) plugin for setting up a multi-langual site as it prevents the editors from having to upload images twice.

Based on a blogpost by [Aaron Eaton](http://blog.channeleaton.com/sharing-media-libraries-across-network-sites).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= About Permissions =

This plugin depends on the global WordPress blog permissions for viewing and editing Media.

Only blogs where the user has 'upload_files' permission are shown in the Network Shared Media tab.

If a user doesn't have the 'upload_files' permission on the current (active) blog, the tab isn't shown at all since that user can't access the Add Media pop-up window.
